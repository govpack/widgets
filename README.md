### 2559+ widgets/wheels subject to constant/ongoing reinvention

_a standard story for reuse may remain a futile goal, the constant need/desire to re-invent is infinite as is the domain_

one way forward would be to universalise catagories or types of widgets in a common/universal framework and compete them 

(this way reinvention becomes a far more worthwhile goal than reuse, and reuse itself would be better served, and more likely to occur, by having a bigger/better pool of widgets, from which to choose, to reuse)
